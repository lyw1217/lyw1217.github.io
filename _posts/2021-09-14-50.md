The Service-Indication AVP is of type OctetString. This AVP contains the Service Indication that identifies a service or a set of services in an AS and the related repository data in the HSS. Standardized values of Service-Indication identifying a standardized service or  set of services in the AS and standardized format of the related repository data are defined in 3GPP TS 29.364 [10].


- 29.328

Identifier of one set of service related transparent data, which is stored in an HSS in an operator network per Public Identity.

The HSS shall allocate memory space to implement a data repository to store transparent data per IMS Public User Identity or Public Service Identity and value of Service Indication with a Sequence Number for verification.

For Public Service Identities matching a Wildcarded Public Service Identity, the repository data shall be stored per Wildcarded Public Service Identity and not for each specific Public Service Identity.

This data contents included in the Sh-Pull Resp, Sh-Subs-Notif Resp or Sh-Notif depends on whether Requested Identity Set information element was included in the Sh-Pull or Sh-Subs-Notif, as follows:
-	When this information element takes the value IMPLICIT_IDENTITIES, the HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public Identities that belong to the same implicit registration set as the IMS Public Identity included in the message in the User-Identity AVP. The MSISDN and External Identifier within the User-Identity AVP are not applicable for this value. If the User Identity is a Public Service Identity, the HSS shall return only the User Identity received in the request.
-	When this information element takes the value ALIAS_IDENTITIES, the HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public User Identities that are in the same Alias Public User Identity Set as the IMS Public User Identity included in the message in the User-Identity AVP (see 3GPP TS 23.008 [27] for the definition of Alias Public User Identity Set). The MSISDN, the Public Service Identity and the External Identifier within the User-Identity AVP are not applicable for this value.
-	When this information element takes the value REGISTERED_IDENTITIES, the HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public Identities whose state is registered, belonging to all Private Identities that the IMS Public Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier in the User-Identity AVP is associated with. If the User Identity is a Public Service Identity, the HSS shall return no identities in the response.
-	When this information element takes the value ALL_IDENTITIES, the HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public Identities, belonging to all Private Identities that the User Identity is associated with.
-	When this information element is not included, the HSS shall download the set of IMS Public Identities that would be downloaded if the value of this information element had been ALL_IDENTITIES.
An IMS Public Identity would be either:
-	associated with the same Private User Identity or Private Service Identity as the User Identity included in the request or
-	associated with the MSISDN present in the request or
-	associated with an External Identifier present in the request.
Multiple instances of this information element may be included in the message.

If the HSS has to communicate with the MSC/VLR or SGSN and/or MME and/or 3GPP AAA Server to retrieve location information, it shall make use of the service MAP-PROVIDE-SUBSCRIBER-INFO or S6a/S6d-IDR or SWx-PPR. This information element shall contain the location information as received from the access nodes.
If the HSS cannot communicate with the VLR or SGSN or MME (e.g., because the UE is purged), or if the HSS cannot retrieve the location information from the serving nodes because they do not support such feature, the HSS shall provide locally stored location information if available (e.g., serving node name, Visited PLMN ID) received in a previous Update Location message, and the last known UE's location if available e.g. as received in the Purge message from VLR or SGSN or MME.
If the Serving Node Indication was present in the request, the location information shall contain the serving node address(es) as stored in the HSS, according to the requested domain and the requested nodes (if received). Other location information may be absent, in order to eliminate unnecessary communication with the MSC/VLR or SGSN and/or MME and/or 3GPP AAA Server when the AS does not require these information elements.
For both Location Information for CS and Location Information for GPRS, the considerations described in 3GPP TS 23.078 [14] apply.

### Charging information


<details>
<summary>접기/펼치기</summary>

This information element contains the addresses of the charging functions: primary Online Charging Function (PrimaryEventChargingFunctionName), secondary Online Charging Function (SecondaryEventChargingFunctionName), primary Charging Data Function (PrimaryChargingCollectionFunctionName), and secondary Charging Data Function (SecondaryChargingCollectionFunctionName). When a clash occurs between the charging function address(es) received over the ISC interface and those received over the Sh interface, the address(es) received over the ISC interface should take precedence.
NOTE:	The use of the Sh interface to retrieve charging function addresses is not intended as a general-purpose alternative to receiving charging function addresses from the ISC interfaces. Rather, it is meant to address a special case where the AS needs to interact with the charging system before initiating a request to a user when the AS has not received the third party REGISTER for that user.
The AS shall extract the FQDN of the DiameterURI in these information elements and may use it as content of the Destination-Host AVP for the Diameter accounting requests. The parent domain of the FQDN in the DiameterURI shall be used as Destination-Realm. The number of labels used for the Destination-Realm shall be determined before the Charging Information is provisioned and may be a configuration option.
NOTE:	A FQDN is an absolute domain name including a subdomain and its parent domain. The subdomain and the parent domain contain one or more labels separated by dots.
