## 3. 가입자 인증(Cx / Multimedia-Auth Req/Ans , MAR/MAA)

> Authentication procedures

- End User와 Home IMS Network 간의 인증을 위한 정보를 교환하기 위해 S-CSCF 와 HSS 사이에서 사용되는 절차
- Cx-AV-Req 및 Cx-AV-Req-Resp
- HSS 에서 인증 벡터(authentication vectors)를 검색(retrieve)
- 이 기능을 지원하는 인증 방식(예, IMS-AKA)을 위해 UE와 HSS의 sequence numbers 간의 동기화 실패를 해결
- NASS-level의 인증 결과를 IMS level로 승격(promote)합니다.
- HSS에서 GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication(GIBA)에 대한 IP 주소 보안 바인딩 정보를 검색합니다.

<details>
<summary>접기/펼치기</summary>

This procedure is used between the S-CSCF and the HSS to exchange information to support the authentication between the end user and the home IMS network. 

The procedure is invoked by the S-CSCF, corresponds to the combination of the operations Cx-AV-Req and Cx-AV-Req-Resp (see  TS 33.203 [3]) and is used:

-	To retrieve authentication vectors from the HSS.

-	To resolve synchronization failures between the sequence numbers in the UE and the HSS for authentication schemes that support this capability (e.g. IMS-AKA).

-	To promote the result of the NASS-level authentication to the IMS level.

-	To retrieve the IP-address secure binding information for GPRS-IMS-Bundled Authentication (GIBA) from the HSS.

This procedure is mapped to the commands Multimedia-Auth-Request/Answer in the Diameter application specified in  TS 29.229 [5]. Tables 6.3.1 through 6.3.7 detail the involved information elements.

3. `User-Name`

    Private Identity.

    It shall be present if it is available when the S-CSCF issues the request.

    It may be absent during the initiation of a session to an unregistered Public Identity (Server-Assignment-Type shall contain the value UNREGISTERED_USER) or after S-CSCF recovery upon originating request different than REGISTER (Server-Assignment-Type shall contain the value NO_ASSIGNMENT).

    In case of de-registration, Server-Assignment-Type equal to TIMEOUT_DEREGISTRATION, ADMINISTRATIVE_DEREGISTRATION, DEREGISTRATION_TOO_MUCH_DATA or TIMEOUT_DEREGISTRATION_STORE_SERVER_NAME if no Public-Identity AVPs are present then User-Name AVP shall be present.

4. `Server-Assignment-Type`
        
    Type of update, request or notification that the S-CSCF requests in the HSS (e.g: de-registration). See 3GPP TS 29.229 [5] for all the possible values.

5. `User-Data-Already-Available`
        
    This indicates if the user profile and charging information and, if supported and present in the subscription, allowed WAF and/or WWSF identities are already available in the S-CSCF.

    In the case where Server-Assignment-Type is not equal to NO_ASSIGNMENT, REGISTRATION, RE_REGISTRATION or UNREGISTERED_USER, the HSS shall not use User Data Already Available when processing the request.

6. `SCSCF-Restoration-Info`

    When the S-CSCF supports IMS Restoration Procedures, if Server-Assignment-Type is REGISTRATION or RE_REGISTRATION, and any of the related restoration information changed compared to the previous one, the S-CSCF shall send this information element to the HSS. This information allows a later retrieval in case of an S-CSCF service interruption.

### 4.2. Response 주요 AVPs

1. `User-Name`

    Private Identity.

    It shall be present if it is available when the HSS sends the response.

    It may be absent in the following error case: when the Server-Assignment-Type of the request is UNREGISTERED_USER and the received Public Identity is not known by the HSS.

2. `User-Data`
        
    Relevant user profile.

    It shall be present when Server-Assignment-Type in the request is equal to NO_ASSIGNMENT, REGISTRATION, RE_REGISTRATION or UNREGISTERED_USER according to the rules defined in clause 6.6.

    If the S-CSCF receives more data than it is prepared to accept, it shall perform the de-registration of the Private Identity with Server-Assignment-Type set to DEREGISTRATION_TOO_MUCH_DATA and send back a SIP 3xx or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response, which shall trigger the selection of a new S-CSCF by the I-CSCF, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [8].

3. `Charging-Information`
        
    Addresses of the charging functions.

    It shall be present when the User-Data AVP is sent to the S-CSCF according to the rules defined in clause 6.6.

    When this parameter is included, either the Primary-Charging-Collection-Function-Name AVP or the Primary-Event-Charging-Function-Name AVP shall be included. All other elements shall be included if they are available.


4. `SCSCF-Restoration-Info`

    This information shall be present if it was stored by the S-CSCF in the HSS and Server-Assignment-Type is either UNREGISTERED_USER or NO_ASSIGNMENT.

    This information shall also be present if it was stored by the S-CSCF in the HSS and the SAR indicates it is related to a multiple registration and Server-Assignment-Type is REGISTRATION.

    This information may be present if it was stored by the S-CSCF in the HSS and Server-Assignment-Type is either REGISTRATION or RE-REGISTRATION and there are other Private Identities different from the Private Identity received in the SAR command being registered with the Public Identity received in the SAR command.

The de-registration reason is composed of two parts: one textual message (if available) that is intended to be forwarded to the user that is de-registered, and one reason code (see 3GPP TS 29.229 [5]) that determines the behaviour of the S-CSCF 

4. `Destination-Host`
