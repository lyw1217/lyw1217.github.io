Temporary PuID에 대해서 규격을 찾아보다가

3GPP TS 23003 "Numbering, addressing and identification" 에 정의된 부분이 있어서 발췌

>13.4B   Temporary Public User Identity
>For 3GPP systems, if there is no ISIM application to host the Public User Identity, a Temporary Public User Identity shall be derived, based on the IMSI. The Temporary Public User Identity shall be of the form as described in clause 13.4 and shall consist of the string "sip:" appended with a username and domain portion  equal to the IMSI derived Private User Identity, as described in clause 13.2. An example using the same example IMSI from clause 13.2 can be found below:

>EXAMPLE:          "sip:234150999999999@ims.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org".
>
>For 3GPP2 systems, if there is no IMC present, the UE shall derive the public user identity as described in Annex C of 3GPP2 X.S0013-004 [67].
